# Organization
1. Please put your files in the correct folders. I worked hard on creating the organazation of the project and don't ruin it.

2. Keep everything organized meaning don't put package.json in core, and package-lock.json in assets/images. It will cause a syntax error.

# Using ShellScript files

# Please be careful using shellscript files. They are very dangerous. Please use them only if nessescary.

# ShellScripts are only used for system wide actions or actions that are hard. Please use the terminal and shellscripts for heavy tasks


Using the terminal

1. The terminal is a tool. It is not a system destoryer.

2. The terminal is a portable tool for running commands and it is godly for coding.

# Debugging and coding style

1. Please use comments in code. It helps me understand better.
2. Use panels like the terminal or debug console or output. Those tools are godly for understanding and fixing code.
